using PracticeArrays;
//1.String: is immutable. I think it could store some important data.
//  StringBuilder: is mutable. It could be used in methods so that we can change the text based on needs.
//2. Base class for arrays: Object class.
//3. Sort an array: Array.Sort()
//4. Get the total number of elements in an array: Array.Length
//5. Store multiple data types in System.Array: object array could store multiple data types in an array.
//6. Difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone():
//   Clone(): returns a new array (a shallow copy) object containing all the elements in the original array. 
//   CopyTo(): copies the elements into another existing array. Both perform a shallow copy.
