//1. Discribe the problem generics address: Generics allows us to design classes and methods but defer the specification of types until the class or methods are declared and called
//2. List<T> a = new List<T>(); List<string> a = new List<string>();
//3. The Dictionary class have below generic type parameters: 2, because dictionary are key-value pairs.
//   Dictionary<TKey, TValue> a = new Dictionary<TKey, TValue>();
//4. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
//5. Add() could add an object to the end of list.
//6. Remove(): remove the first match object from the list;
//   RemoveAt(): remove the object which the index points.
//7. There's a <T> after the class name.
//8.  Generic classes can  have multiple generic type parameters.
//9. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
//10. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
