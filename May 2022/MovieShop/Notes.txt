MVC -> Model View Controller

Model
View
Controller -> a C# class that inhertis from Controller class
		-> Many Action methods

https://localhost:7033/home/index
return View() will return the view with the same name as action method name
return View("SomeViewName") also

Views in MVC are called Razor view with cshtml extension -> combine C# and HTML code

HTTP Requests ->
GET => top 30 movies, get user by id, get movies for genre is 3
POST => Register User, Login
PUT => Edit Profile
DELETE => Delete account

Get User Info
https://localhost:7033/user/details/1
1. UserController -> Controllers
2. Create Details action method -> GET
2. User folder inside Views
3. Create details.cshtml


Organize our code properly
Code should be reusable cod and easily testable


Entities represents your Database tables
Movie table => Movie class columns will be mapped with properties
Genre => Genre class

Models/ViewModels/DTO (Data Transfer Objects) => Views
Home Page => MovieCardModel => PosterUrl, Id, Title
You create model classes based on the requirement of the View

Repositories class/ interfaces they deal with Entity classes
Services classes/ interfaces they deal with Model classes
